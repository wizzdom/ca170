 What is the environment variable $PATH? 
a variable that contains a colon seperated list of all the paths to programs on the system

 Show me the value of $PATH 
for me it is: /sbin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/home/wizzdom/.local/bin:/home/wizzdom/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin:/home/wizzdom/.dotnet/tools:/home/wizzdom/scripts:/home/wizzdom/.local/bin:/home/wizzdom/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin:/home/wizzdom/.dotnet/tools:/usr/lib/jvm/default/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl:/home/wizzdom/.local/bin:/home/wizzdom/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin:/home/wizzdom/.dotnet/tools:/home/wizzdom/scripts Usually contains at least: /sbin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:$HOME/.local/bin

 Find what directory "ls" is in. 
use command: "which ls" - /bin/ls which is symliked to /sbin/ls

 Show the file size of the "ls" program. 
use command: "ls -lh /sbin/ls" - 135K on my system

 Two programs, in different directories, have the same name. One is a system program. The other is a script that you wrote. What happens when you type that name? 
the system's program will run (usually)

 In the previous, if you find the system program is running when you type that name, how can you make sure that your program runs instead? 
add the script's directory to the PATH variable before the path of the directory of the system program for it to take precedence

 EXTRA QUESTION (only for experienced Linux people): Get the value of $PATH and translate all the ":" characters to newline characters. 
echo $PATH | sed 's/:/\n/g'

 What is the effect of the following Linux command? ls -al > myfile 
adds the names of all the the contents of the current directory to a file called 'myfile'

 What will this do? cd ls -alR 
list all the contents of the user's home directory recursively (including children of those directories) in long format

 What will this do? cd / ls -alR 
list all the contents of the root directory recursively (lists all the files and folders in the whole system)

 What will this do? cd / ls -al > outputfile.log 
changes directory to root directory and makes a file there called 'outputfile.log' which contains a list of all the files in the root directory in long format (if the user has permission to make a file there, if not it will raise an error)

 What will this do? cd / ls -al > $HOME/outputfile.log 
changes directory to root directory and makes a file in the user's home directory called 'outputfile.log' which contains a list of all the files in the root directory in long format

 Typing the command man man > man does what? 
makes a file in the current directory called 'man' which contains the manual page for the 'man' command
